# Sniffing

Sniffing is the technique of continuously monitoring and recording all data packets that transit via a network. 

## Types

	1. Active Sniffing
 		Active Sniffing is sniffing in the switch. It is a network device that connects two points. This switch monitors the MAC addresses on each port, which ensures that data is passed only to the appropriate destination.
   	2. Passive Sniffing
    		The process of Sniffing through the hub is called passive Sniffing. All machines on an un-bridged or non-switched network segment will be able to see any traffic passing through it. They operate on the data link layer of the network. 

# Spoofing

Spoofing is the act of disguising a communication or identity so that it appears to be associated with a trusted, authorized source.

## Types

 	1. Caller ID Spoofing : Spoofing takes place when the caller ID is changed by using false information.
	2. Email Spoofing : Scammers use fake sender addresses to harm your computer, steal your information, or infect your computer with malware through email Spoofing.
 	3. Website Spoofing : Scammers use legitimate fonts, colors, and logos to make a dangerous website appear to be a secure one.
  	4. DNS Server Spoofing : DNS Spoofing, also known as cache poisoning, is the process of rerouting traffic to a different IP address. Malicious websites will be redirected to this page. Scammers do this by replacing the DNS server’s IP addresses with their own.
	5. GPS Spoofing : A GPS Spoofing attack occurs when fake signals resemble real signals and are broadcast to fool GPS receivers. Essentially, scammers pretend to be in one place, while, in reality, being in another place.
 	6. ARP Spoofing : ARP Spoofing is to manipulate and steal data as well as hijack sessions. As a result, spammers will connect their media access control to the IP address to access the data belonging to the owner of that address.
  	7. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack : MitM attacks occur when scammers hack a Wi-Fi network or create an identical counterfeit network to intercept web traffic between two parties. This allows scammers to reroute credit card numbers or login information to themselves.
   	8. Text Message Spoofing : The practice of Spoofing texts occurs when scammers use another person’s phone number to send a text message.
	9. Extension Spoofing : Extension Spoofing is used by scammers to mask malware extension folders. These hacker files are often renamed as filename.txt.exe, and have malware hidden inside.
